# ti99sim

This is a fork of ti99sim0.16.0 from 
[https://mrousseau.org/programs/ti99sim/](https://mrousseau.org/programs/ti99sim/).

Many thanks for Mark Rousseau for the monumental effort of creating this
awesome simulator!

This fork was created for the following purposes:

1.  Share patches I've created in order to fix build issues, modernize the
    code, and port to other Unix variants.  See the commits for changes
    and rationale.

2.  Invite input from others interested in contributing to ti99sim.

3.  To provide a forum for discussions specific to ti99sim.

Note: There are several TI-99/4a ROM files floating around the Internet,
but the only one I found that works is the one downloaded by the
provided setup / ti99-setup scripts from ftp.whtech.com.
