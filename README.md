This is a fork of ti99sim0.16.0 from

Many thanks for Mark Rousseau for the monumental effort of creating this
cool simulator!

This fork was created for the following purposes:

1.  Share patches I've created in order to modernize the
    code and port to other Unix variants.  See the commits for changes
    and rationale.

2.  Invite input from others interested in contributing to ti99sim.

3.  To provide a forum for discussions specific to ti99sim.
